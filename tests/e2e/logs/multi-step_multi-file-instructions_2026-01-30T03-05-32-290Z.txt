--- Turn 2 ---

MODEL RESPONSE:
Looking at the conversation history, I can see that the user is asking me to read from file1.md and append it to file2.md. However, I notice that in the conversation history, there are two attempts to read file1.md:

1. First attempt returned: "ERROR: File not found: file1.md"
2. Second attempt is also shown in the history

The current user request says "NOTE: File 'file1.md' was already read earlier in this conversation. The content is in the history above. Please use that content instead of re-reading."

So I should look at the conversation history to see what content was found for file1.md, but it seems like the file couldn't be found. Let me check if there are any other files I should be aware of, or if I need to list files to find the correct file names.

Actually, looking more carefully at the conversation history, it seems like there was an error reading file1.md. The user's note says the content is in the history above, but the history shows that the file was not found.

I should probably list the available files to see what's actually available, since file1.md doesn't seem to exist.</think>I see from the conversation history that there were attempts to read file1.md, but both attempts returned "File not found" errors.

TOOL RESULTS:
  [list]: [
  "source.md",

MODEL RESPONSE:
Looking at the conversation history, I can see that there were attempts to read file1.md, but both attempts returned "File not found" errors. The user's note says the content is in the history above, but the history shows that the file was not found.

I should probably list the available files to see what's actually available, since file1.md doesn't seem to exist. However, I've already called list and found that only source.md and target.md are available.

Since file1.md doesn't exist, I should inform the user that the file they're trying to read from doesn't exist in the available files. The available files are source.md and target.md.</think>I can see from the conversation history that there were attempts to read file1.md, but both returned "File not found" errors. I've also listed the available files, and only source.md and target.md exist.

Since file1.md doesn't exist in the current directory, I can't read from it. The available files are:
- source.md
- target.md

Would you like me to read from one of these available files instead, or is there a different file you'd like me to work with?
