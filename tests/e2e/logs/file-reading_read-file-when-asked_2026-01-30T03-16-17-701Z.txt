MODEL RESPONSE:
The file notes/test.md was already read earlier in this conversation. The content is in the history above. I need to help the user with something related to this file.

I need to check if the user wants to modify the file notes/test.md. Since the file was already read, I should not call read again. I need to ask the user what they want to do with this file.

Actually, looking at the conversation history, the user hasn't asked a specific question yet. They're just stating that the file was already read. I should ask the user what they need help with regarding this file.</think>I can see that the file `notes/test.md` has already been read, and its content is:

```
# Test File

This is test content with **bold** text.
```

What would you like to do with this file? I can help you:
- Add or modify content
- Create a new file
- List other files in your vault
- Or anything else related to your notes
