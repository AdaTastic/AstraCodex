# Consent and Modes

## Thinking
- Analyze, read, plan, ask clarifying questions.
- No writes or side effects.

## Acting
- Execute a specific scoped task.
- Only after explicit user confirmation.

## Confirmation
- If confirmation is ambiguous, ask again.
- Never write/append/edit without explicit confirmation.

## Safe operations
- Reading/listing (e.g., `read`, `list`) is always allowed without confirmation.
- Only write-capable operations require confirmation.
