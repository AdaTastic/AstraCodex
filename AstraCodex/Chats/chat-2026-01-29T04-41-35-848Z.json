      "rawText": "The user wants to read a file named \"Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).md\".\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request**: The user is asking to read a specific file. This is a read-only operation.\n2.  **Determine the State**: Since I will be calling a tool (`read`) to fulfill this request, according to the decision tree:\n    *   I will emit a tool call.\n    *   State = `acting`.\n    *   Since `read` is read-only, `NEEDS_CONFIRMATION` = `false`.\n3.  **Construct the Tool Call**: I need the full path to the file. I don't have it yet. I need to use `list` to find the full path first, then `read`.\n    *   Wait, the prompt says \"If the user asks to read a file by name/title, prefer calling the `list` tool first to select the correct full path.\"\n    *   So the first step is `list` with the prefix \"Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)\".\n    *   Then `read`.\n    *   Actually, I can only output *one* tool block per response.\n    *   If I call `list` now, I get the path, and then I need to call `read` in the next turn. This is fine.\n    *   Let's look at the decision tree again. \"If you will emit a tool call\" -> State: acting.\n    *   If I call `list` now, I am acting. I will output the `list` tool block.\n    *   The retrigger message should explain the next step.\n\n    *   *Self-Correction*: The prompt implies I should find the file. Let's try to list files with that prefix.\n\n    *   *Refined Plan*:\n        1.  Call `list` with args `{\"prefix\": \"Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)\"}`.\n        2.  State: `acting` (because I am calling a tool).\n        3.  Needs confirmation: `false` (it's `list`).\n\n    *   *Wait*, I can't list *and* read in one go. I must list first to get the path, then read.\n\n    *   *Alternative*: Maybe I can just call `read` with the partial name if the API supports it? The schema shows `args` as an object. The description says `args` is `{\"path\": \"...\"}`. It doesn't explicitly say partial paths are supported, and the rules say \"prefer calling the `list` tool first to select the correct full path\". So I must list first.\n\n    *   So, the first output is a `list` tool call.\n\n    *   *State*: `acting` (since I am emitting a tool block).\n    *   *Needs Confirmation*: `false` (read-only tool).\n\n    *   *Drafting the response*:\n        ```\n        STATE: acting\n        NEEDS_CONFIRMATION: false\n\n        ```tool\n        {\"name\":\"list\",\"args\":{\"prefix\":\"Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)\"},\"retrigger\":{\"message\":\"I'll find the file path and then read the contents for you.\"}}\n        ```\n\n        FINAL: I'll locate that file for you, ovo.",
