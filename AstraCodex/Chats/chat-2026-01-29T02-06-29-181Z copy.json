They are often caused by nutrient over-enrichment, particularly from agricultural runoff and wastewater discharge.\n\n## Key Points\n- **Causes:** Excess nutrients (nitrates, phosphates) from agricultural runoff, wastewater discharge, and climate change (warming waters).\n- **Effects:** Marine life mortality, shellfish poisoning, human health risks, economic losses due to fishery closures.\n- **Remediation:** Bioremediation (using algae-eating organisms), nutrient management in runoff, and monitoring systems.\n\n## Key Data Points\n- *Last bloom:* July 15, 2024 (today's date).\n- *Impact:* Severe shellfish poisoning risk for local shellfish populations.\n- *Action:* Bioremediation efforts are ongoing.\n- *Economic impact:* $X million in fishery closures.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Continue monitoring the bloom's progression.\n- Investigate the source of nutrient over-enrichment.\n- Implement bioremediation protocols.\n\n---\n\n**Created:** 2024-07-15\n**Modified:** 2024-07-15\n\n```\n\nSTATE: idle\nNEEDS_CONFIRMATION: false\n\nFINAL: I've read the file.
