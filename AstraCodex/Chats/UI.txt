I found the file! It looks like a structured template for tracking Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), with sections for observations, context, toxins, thresholds, monitoring, regulations, funding, risk assessment, and open questions.

Would you like me to help you fill this out? I can:
- Draft observations for a specific event
- Flesh out the monitoring or regulatory sections
- Help you set up a routine for tracking HABs

Just let me know what you'd like to do! ✧
