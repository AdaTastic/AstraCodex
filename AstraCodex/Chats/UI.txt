STATE: thinking
I can see from the conversation history that the user asked me to read the file "Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)", and I have successfully read it. The file appears to be a structured template for documenting and tracking Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) events, with sections for observations, context, toxicity, thresholds, monitoring, regulations, funding, risk assessment, and open questions. The file is currently empty (just placeholders). Now I need to respond to the user with the content of the file and offer next steps.</think>I’ve read the file for you. ovo

It’s a structured HAB template with placeholders in these sections:

- 0) One-paragraph summary
- 1) Observations log (local)
- 2) Context: post-wildfire + first rains
- 3) HAB types & key toxins (freshwater and marine)
- 4) Thresholds & action levels (table)
- 5) Monitoring & infrastructure
- 6) Regulatory timeline
- 7) Funding & capacity tracking
- 8) Risk assessment for residents
- 9) Open questions / TODO

The current state is mostly a framework with no content filled in yet.

What would you like to do next? For example:
- Fill in specific sections with observations or data
- Draft new content for one of the sections
- Clarify how you want to organize the HAB tracking (e.g., per event?)
- Something else?
